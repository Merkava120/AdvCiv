This branch "base" is the platform for my modding projects:
-Tactical Civ, which just tweaks Civ4 ranged combat to better suit a tactical game
-Dynamica, which will eventually overhaul every part of Civ4 to better reflect the nonlinearity of history

The SDK for these projects will exist in "base" but be unused for the base mod, which is simply
-AdvCivPlus,
-Platy UI (not added yet)
-Zlatko mini formations (not added yet)
-Minor tweaks to existing SDK as I develop the other mods.

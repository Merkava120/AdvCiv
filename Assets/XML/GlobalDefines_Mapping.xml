	<!-- The biome mapper runs through tiles and sorts them into 'biomes' based on what terrains they are adjacent to. 
		Then it takes a second pass through the tiles to check if any are adjacent to LESS than this number of tiles sharing their biome, 
		and flips those tiles to the most common adjacent biome. 
		Default value of 1 means the second pass flips any tile that is adjacent to zero tiles sharing its biome. -->
